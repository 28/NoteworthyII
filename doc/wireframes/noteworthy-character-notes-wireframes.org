* Noteworthy II Wireframes
  This document describes the look and feel of the character notes
  screen in Noteworthy II.
** Current look
*** V 2.3.0 - latest version for Retail and Classic (era)
    This is the current look of the character notes screen as of version
    2.3.0. The textbox displays the notes of the character that is selected
    in the drop-down menu above. 'Save' button saves all changes made in the
    textbox and closes the screen. 'Cancel' button discards all changes
    and closes the screen.

** Note categories look proposals
   A new feature is in the development for Noteworthy II - the character
   notes categories. It will enable players to further divide character
   notes into smaller units. The idea is to have unlimited categories
   with the ability to add new ones and delete existing ones. This is
   a collection of wireframes that display this new feature in the
   Noteworthy II UI. None of them is implemented.
*** Tabbed look
    In this iteration categories are displayed in tabs above the
    textbox. Clicking on the tab displays the notes for that
    category.

    Adding and removing of tabs is tricky in WoW UI framework and
    many tabs can render them unreadable make it that this version
    is least likely to be implemented.

*** Drop down menu look
    This iteration packs the note categories in a drop-down menu exactly
    the same as for character choice. Selecting the item in the drop-down
    menu displays the notes for that category in the textbox.

    This is the simplest solution in terms of implementing so it is currently
    the main candidate.

      { Page: | ^Turuvid-Argent Dawn^ }

      {SI
       Character notes                                            .

      { [Save] | [Cancel] }
      }
      @endsalt
    #+END_SRC

*** Selection list look
    The most advanced iteration has a scrollable list of all available
    categories to the left of the textbox. Selecting the item from
    the list displays the notes assigned to that category.

    This has the most complicated back-end implementation so it will
    most likely be discarded. However, the analysis is still going.
