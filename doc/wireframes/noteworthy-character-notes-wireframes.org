* Wireframes
This document describes the look and feel of the character notes
screen in Noteworthy II and proposes some new features.
** Current look
*** V 2.4.4 - latest version
This is the current look of the character notes screen as of version
2.4.4. The textbox displays the notes of the character that is selected
in the drop-down menu above. 'Save' button saves all changes made in the
textbox and closes the screen. 'Cancel' button discards all changes
and closes the screen.

The 'Remind <character\under{}name> at logon' checkbox triggers a reminder
screen next time the character logs-on to the world when checked.
The reminder can open the character notes or be rescheduled to trigger
again.

There are the 'Close' ('X') and 'Undo' buttons on the top right of
the frame but they are omitted in these wireframes for clarity.

** New look proposals
A new feature is in the development for Noteworthy II - the personal
character notes categories. It will enable players to further divide
character notes into smaller units. The idea is to have unlimited
categories with the ability to add new ones and delete existing ones.
This is a collection of wireframes that serve as proposals for implementing
the new feature in the UI. None of them are implemented.
*** Tabbed look
In this iteration categories are displayed in tabs above the
textbox. Clicking on the tab displays the notes for that
category.

Adding and removing of tabs is tricky in WoW UI framework and
many tabs can render them unreadable.

*** Drop-down menu look
This iteration packs the note categories in a drop-down menu exactly
the same as for character selection. Selecting the item in the drop-down
menu displays the notes for that category in the textbox.

  }

*** Selection list look
The most advanced iteration has a scrollable list of all available
categories to the left of the textbox. Selecting the item from
the list displays the notes assigned to that category.

There is no native way to implement this in WoW UI framework, so
this solution can introduce more 3rd party dependencies.
