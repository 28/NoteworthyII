* Perform undo command activity diagram
  This diagram depicts what happens when the 'Undo' button is pressed.

  When the button is pressed the stack size is checked to see if anything
  is saved. If not, the action is completed. If anything is saved then
  stack size must be asserted. If there is only one element is saved
  it is presumed that it is the initial state - the first text version
  saved when the window is opened. In this case only the copy is returned
  without removing the element from the stack. This is done to preserve
  the initial state for future text changes that will be added to the stack.
  In case there are more elements saved, the first one that differs from
  the current text is returned and all elements up to and including that
  one are removed from the stack.
