## Installation

2. Unzip the contents to the location: '<wow_install_directory>\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\';

Note that the zip archive already contains the 'NoteworthyII' directory which should be extracted as is.
This means that the final path after the extraction will be: '<wow_install_directory>\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\NoteworthyII';
3. Start the game; Noteworthy II should be listed in the 'AddOns' game menu.

### CurseForge (Overwolf) app

1. Start the [CurseForge (Overwolf) app](https://curseforge.overwolf.com);
2. Select 'World of Warcraft' game;
3. Go to 'Get More Addons' tab;
4. In the top search bar type 'Noteworthy II';
5. Click the 'Install' button in the 'Action' column or select the addon and press the 'Install' button on the upper right;
6. When installed, start the game; Noteworthy II should be listed in the 'AddOns' game menu.

### WoWUp

1. Start the [WowUp app](https://wowup.io);
2. Navigate to 'Get Addons' tab;
3. In the upper left search menu type 'Noteworthy II';
4. Select the addon from the list and click install;
5. When installed, start the game; Noteworthy II should be listed in the 'AddOns' game menu.

### Important

NOTE: If you are updating to V2.0 (or higher) from an earlier version, please
delete your old 'Noteworthy' folder first (your settings and data will be unaffected;
v2.0 folder now has a different name).
This is just to clear out some old files that are no longer being used.

## Development

Noteworthy II development is meant to go in cycles. Code is developed in a
separate directory and when needed it is 'deployed' in WoW, tested then
repeat. All scripts packed in the project exist to support this
philosophy.

Noteworthy II project file structure:
```
+- src
	+- lua
		|- GhostLib.lua ---> Code for text editing
		|- NoteworthyBroker.lua ---> Contains LDB code for Noteworthy II
		|- NoteworthyMain.lua ---> Main library code
		|- NoteworthySystem.lua ---> Code for menus, commands and misc
	+- xml
		|- GhostLib.xml ---> Reusable XML templates
		|- NoteworthyButton.xml ---> Code for the floating button
		|- NoteworthyOptions.xml ---> Noteworthy II settings that appear in Interface/AddOns game menu
		|- NoteworthyTemplates.xml ---> Noteworthy II specific reusable XML templates
		|- NoteworthyWindows.xml ---> Noteworthy II main XML file (main and alert windows)
|- NoteworthyII.toc ---> The TOC file
```

Noteworthy II XML structure leverages heavily on inheritance, and
components are located in multiple files. Here is a diagram of
inheritance trying to explain which component is in which file and 
which component inherits which.

### Noteworthy Wrapper

Noteworthy Wrapper is a custom-made build tool for Noteworthy II.
See the [documentation](/noteworthy-wrapper/README.md) for more info.

### Upcoming

There is no schedule or release date for these features, they are here only for the record.

1. Undo feature
2. ~~Move settings to the Interface/Addon game menu~~ (Done in v2.1.0)
3. ~~Restructure the source code to make it more manageable (decide what to do with GhostLib)~~ (New structure implemented
and GhostLib is merged to Noteworthy II source.)
4. ~~Add entries from Combat log to Quick Notes~~ (Decided to omit this as it is to complicated to be a nice-to-have
feature. There are better add-ons that deal with this problem.)

#### Requests from the community

These have a slightly higher priority.

1. ~~Character notes should be saved as 'Character-Realm' instead of just 'Character' so that same-named characters
from different realms can have their own notes.~~ (Introduced in V2.2.0)
2. Multiple personal notes per character. It will be easier to divide the notes per topic. Leaning toward the multiple
named tabs in the character notes panel, but not yet confirmed.

### Known issues

- Noteworthy II main window drag can sometimes misbehave like jumping on screen on mouse key. This will be solved
as soon as possible. If it becomes too irritating, reload the UI with `/reload` command.
- ~~If a character who has valid notes (they at least logged in with Noteworthy II on) is deleted, their notes remain
present in the character notes panel without the option to be removed. This will be handled in one of the upcoming
releases.~~ (v2.1.0 introduced migrate and delete character notes feature)
- Sometimes the cursor can misbehave during notes writing (any note type) - randomly change position in the text.
I'm still investigating the issue and hopefully it will be solved as soon as possible.

Suggestions for solutions are always welcome! Submit a pull request or open an issue. Thanks!
